You can run all the cells of Training and Attack sections. But for the defense section, choose which one you want to test first. I suggest you start by the ineffective defenses then choose either the 'Moving Target Defense' or Defense 2. Be aware once you choose one of the effective defenses, you won't able to test the ineffective defenses.
